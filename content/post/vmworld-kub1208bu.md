Once the recordings for VMworld 2019 US are publicly available this page will reflect on the session I co-presented about Kubernetes Resource Management for vSphere Admins [KUB1208BU].

Since it's a lot of content and resources we covered in the session, we will record short takes on each section from that session and also address questions that came up after the talk.

Stay tuned...
