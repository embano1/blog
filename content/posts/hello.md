...[@bbrundert](https://twitter.com/bbrundert) is the answer (to almost everything btw). 

Well, if it wasn't Björn who finally kicked my \<redacted\>, I think I'd never started my own blog. I'm pretty active on Twitter (@embano1), and never felt the need to share more than 140 characters with the world. But I changed my view last week, after some glass of wine at Björn's "Home Sweet Home". Our discussion went like this:

> *\<Bla bla Kubernetes bla bla...\>*  
> 
> **Björn:** *Dude, you should have a blog!*  
> **Me:** Man, I have no time! And I can't really put together a good blog post, which is both, a funny read and interesting.  
> **Björn:** *May be, but the stuff you're interested in and working on is really cool! It would be a shame if you'd not share it.*  
> **Me:** (thinking)  
> **Björn:** *This Kubernetes Informers stuff you just told me. Is this something everyone knows about?*  
> **Me:** Well, I don't know. Perhaps no one cares about?  
> **Björn:** *I don't think so. Just write it down. Doesn't have to be a book! Just your thoughts, findings, etc.*  
> **Me:** Sounds easy. And actually I see more and more people start writing custom Kubernetes controllers (#FTW!). Last week I had an interesting discussion with a developer from HolidayCheck24. We helped out each other and may be this could be my first blog post?

> *\<More wine...and then it got late again\>*  

So this got me thinking over the weekend. It takes a lot of time (for me as a non-native English writer) to put together a post. I do a lot of research on the matter, want to be precise and provide value to the reader, i.e. picking a topic actually someone cares about but also has not already seen a million posts already. And it should not read like a robot from the 80s has written it.  

But I thought I'd give it a try. To quickly get started, I immediately used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) (Go) and created a embano1.github.io repository. Fairly easy to get a blog these days, isn't it? 

Enough sentimentality Michael, now show me the money...
