  > This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

# A note on e-Subscriptions
- In my oppinion the best way to get access to books, tutorials, live lessons, etc. 
  - Monthly/ annual subscription models.
  - Usually between $150 to $400 a year
- [Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com) 
  - Also includes Packt and other publishers
- [Packt/ Mapt](https://mapt.io)
  - Very good pricing
  - Usually the first to release new stuff (though sometimes quality slightly suffers from that)
  - One token per month to "buy" a book, so you can keep it after you close your account
